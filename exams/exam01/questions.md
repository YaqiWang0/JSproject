* Some questions ask for a code sample - keep them short and to the point.
* Be sure to be clear - be careful not to use vague pronouns like "it" if I can't be completely sure what "it" is.
* I cannot assume knowledge you don't demonstrate, so be clear and explicit.

## Q: What are the 4 ways to create inheritance? (no examples needed, just a sentence describing each)

1.constructor functionï¼šuse new to create a new object and the prototype of the object is inherited;

2.Object.create() create a new object and the new object's prototype is set to the passed object.

3.ES6 class ,create a class and use new to create the object of the class like other languages,then the function in the class is inherited.

4.Brute force:use Object.setPrototypeOf().



## Q: Give a demonstration of 1 way to create JS inheritance to _inherit_ a method named "purr".

```js
const origin= {
purr: function() {
}
};
const inherit = Object.create(origin);
maru.purr();
```



## Q: Give a demonstration of a different way to create JS inheritance to _inherit_ a method named "hiss".

```js

};
const inherit = new Origin();
maru.hiss();
```



## Q: Explain this sentence: "In CSS, you can select an element based on its ancestors, but you can't select an element based on its descendants"  Make an example and say a concept that cannot be selected.

## Q: Explain what a callback is, and give an example.

Callback is a function passed to another function.Example is below:

{
    console.log("I am function A");

    callback("b");
};
function b(name){

}

a(b);
```



## Q: In CSS, what does it mean "You shouldn't name your classes after what they will appear like"?   Why?  Give an example of a class that is well named and a class that is poorly named.

The class should be named by its function rather than its appearance because the class need to be reused.for example, picture 1 is a bird and picture 2 is a house ,the appearances are different but the functions are the same so they may have the same css style, if you name the class picture,then you could reuse this class and both two pictures share the same css style.
